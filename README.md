Sequenzia is a web based file manager and gallery for JuneFS, JuneFS is a Discord-backed Filesystem with large file support.

This is a simple "turn-key" solution for the Kanmi x Sequenzia system. This is meant to be a getting started solution and is not meant for production applications. You should start here and then export the database and manually install the parts if you plan to have a larger and more production ready deployment.
